# CS331 Project 1 (Group # 2)

##  Project 
This project was created as part of **CSCI 331 – Database Systems** to explore creative data storytelling through SQL queries.  
Each group member built **7 mystery-themed SQL cases** using the **Northwinds2022** databases.

###  Team Members
- **Shiwlee Rahman**
- **Eusan Mahatab**

### Objective
To analyze real-world business data using detective-style stories, SQL joins, subqueries, and analytical functions.  
Each query was designed to tell a *“mystery story”* solved through SQL.

##  Tools & Technologies

| **Azure Data Studio** | SQL Query Execution & Notebooks |
| **DBeaver** | Query Testing, Schema Browsing |
| **GitHub** | Version Control, Submission |
