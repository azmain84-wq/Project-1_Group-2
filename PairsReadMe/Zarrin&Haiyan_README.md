# CS331 Project 1 (Group #2)

## Project
This project was created as part of **CSCI 331 – Database Systems** to explore creative data storytelling through SQL queries.  
Each group member built 7 mystery-themed SQL cases using the **Northwinds** and **Northwinds2022** database.

**Team Members:**

## Mysteries by Zarrin Cherry

**Case 1 – The Phantom Shipment**  
Finds orders that appear to have shipped before they were even placed — investigating data inconsistencies.

**Case 2 – The Duplicate Address Conspiracy**  
Detects “different” customers sharing the exact same address, city, and country — potential shell accounts.

**Case 3 – The Bulk Buyer**  
Identifies unusually large one-time orders (≥ 200 units) to flag potential resellers or fraud.

**Case 4 – The Price Spike**  
Compares average sold prices to the catalog price to detect items sold ≥ 30 % above the list price.

**Case 5 – The Employee Lag**  
Reveals sales employees with the longest average delay between order and shipment dates.

**Case 6 – The Category Impostors**  
Finds beverage-related products mis-categorized outside the “Beverages” category (e.g., milk, tea, coffee).

**Case 7 – The Silent Supplier**  
Lists suppliers whose products have never appeared in any order line — possible inactive vendors.
