# CS331 Project 1 – SQL Mystery Cases

This project was created as part of **CSCI 331 – Database Systems** to explore creative data storytelling through SQL queries.  
Each group member built **7 mystery-themed SQL cases** using the **WideWorldImporters** database.

## Mysteries by Christopher Vidal

**Case 1 — Missed the Deadline**  
Finds orders that were required earlier than they shipped or are overdue and still unshipped.

**Case 2 — Catalog vs Reality**  
Compares order line prices to catalog prices, identifying those off by 20% or more.

**Case 3 — The Shared Doorstep**  
Finds different customers shipping to the exact same address — possible reshipper or fraud activity.

**Case 4 — One-Line Splurges**  
Detects orders with only one product line but a total value exceeding $500.

**Case 5 — The Loner Product**  
Identifies products that appear alone on an order at least 80% of the time (and have at least 5 sales).

**Case 6 — Supplier Lock-In**  
Finds customers who get at least 80% of their total purchases from one supplier.

**Case 7 — Not My Home!**  
Uncovers orders shipped to a different country than the customer’s home country.
