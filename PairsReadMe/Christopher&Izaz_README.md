# CS331 Project 1 – SQL Mystery Cases

This project was created as part of **CSCI 331 – Database Systems** to explore creative data storytelling through SQL queries.  
Each group member designed **7 detective-themed SQL cases** using the **WideWorldImporters** database to uncover hidden patterns, trends, and anomalies through data analysis.

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze real-world business data through detective-style stories that can be solved with SQL.  
Each mystery encourages analytical thinking, problem-solving, and proficiency in key SQL concepts such as:
- `JOIN` operations  
- `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`  
- Subqueries and aggregations  
- Conditional logic and filtering  

This project also helped us collaborate effectively through GitHub and practice explaining technical work clearly in a video walkthrough.
