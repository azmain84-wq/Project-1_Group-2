# CSCI331-Group-2-Project 1

### Mystery Data Investigation

Our team created a collection of **SQL mystery cases** designed to reveal hidden insights in business data using creative storytelling.  
Each mystery uses **real datasets Northwinds2022  and applies advanced SQL techniques such as joins, aggregations, subqueries, and common table expressions (CTEs).
We recorded **video walkthroughs** explaining how each case was solved using SQL queries and logic-based data analysis.

##  Goals
- Create **7 individual SQL mystery queries** per member using storytelling format (detective-style cases).  
- Use **Northwinds2022** and **AdventureWorks2017** databases in **Azure Data Studio** or **DBeaver**.  
- Collaborate through **GitHub** for version control and group repository submissions.  
- Record **individual MP4 videos** explaining query logic and results (posted on YouTube).  
- Conduct **pair reviews** of each other’s queries and provide feedback in one combined video.  
- Prepare a **README.md** with project overview, stories, and SQL outputs.  
- Complete the **To-Do List**, **Grantt Chart**, and **NACE reflection**.  
- Use **ChatGPT** responsibly for study support, SQL explanations, and documentation improvement.
